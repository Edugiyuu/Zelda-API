With the exception of Link's Awakening, Majora's Mask, and Tri Force Heroes, an incarnation of Zelda or one of her alter egos (such as Tetra) has always been one of the central characters in the series. Usually but not always, Princess Zelda is the one who sends Link on his mission to save Hyrule and assists him in defeating Ganon. She is also often the possessor of the Triforce of Wisdom. Much like Link, various Princess Zeldas have appeared across the history of Hyrule. While each Zelda is a distinct individual, the fundamental soul of Zelda has endured from one incarnation to the next.",

He is most often the holder of the Triforce of Courage, a sign of his being chosen by the Golden Goddesses. As an adventurous swordsman, Link is almost always seen wielding a sword and shield, usually the Master Sword and Hylian Shield, and has exceptional skill surpassing other proficient sword-wielding fighters such as the Gerudo and even Ganondorf. He is also talented at stealth, as an archer, and using magic (though not to the same degree as Ganon or Princess Zelda, who themselves bear the Triforce of Power and Wisdom, respectively) Specific incarnations of Link may be distinguished by titles such as the iconic Hero of Time in Ocarina of Time and the Hero of Winds in The Wind Waker. All incarnations of Link possess the spirit of the Legendary Hero and are thereby destined to fight evil, specifically his arch-nemesis Ganon, usually under Princess Zelda's orders.",
